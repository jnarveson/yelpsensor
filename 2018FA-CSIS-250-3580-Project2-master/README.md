yelp.py is the final code. 

The idea behind this project was to use Yelp's database for something
that would be of interest to students. I chose to focus on restaurant
data for the sake of simplicity, as well as data volume and quality.

What do students look for when choosing a restaurant? I reasoned as follows:
First, it should be as inexpensive as possible. Second, it should be open for
business during late-night study sessions. Third, it should offer 
delivery and take-out options for a cramming session.

Yelp's data offers the ability to find restaurants that match all three 
criteria. After finding the right restaurants, it is simply a matter of 
parsing and displaying their information. Here too I made a selection with 
students in view. I figured that students are probably less interested in 
detailed reviews than other customers are, for example. The essentials matter
most: a name, a phone number (for ordering), a description, an address, an image, and
and a link for more details if necessary.
